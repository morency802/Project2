                IBM StoredIQ Administrator provides at-a-glance understanding of the different issues that can 
                crop up in the IBM StoredIQ environment. These views are unique to the IBM StoredIQ Administrator 
                application as they provide an overview of how the system is running. They allow access to various 
                pieces of information that are being shared across applications or allow for the management of 
                resources in a centralized manner.

            <p class="- topic/p ">
                The administrator is the person responsible for managing the IBM StoredIQ. This individual has strong 
                understanding of data sources, indexes, data servers, jobs, infosets, and actions. This list provides 
                an overview as to how IBM StoredIQ Administrator works:
                <ul class="- topic/ul ">

                        <p class="- topic/p "><b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Viewing data servers and volumes:</b>Using IBM StoredIQ Administrator, the Administrator 
                            can identify what data servers are deployed, their location, what data is being managed, 
                            and the status of each data server in the system. Volume management is a central component 
                            of IBM StoredIQ. IBM StoredIQ Administrator also allows the Administrator to see what volumes 
                            are currently under management, which data server is responsible for that volume, the state 
                            of the volume after indexing, and the amount and size of information that is contained by each 
                            volume. Administrators can also add volumes to and delete volumes from data servers through 
                            this interface.
                        </p>

                            If IBM StoredIQ is configured for integration with Information Governance Catalog, the 
                            Administrator can also manage which volumes are published to the governance catalog. 
                        </p>

                            <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Scheduling harvests:</b> Harvesting, which can also be referred to as indexing, is the 
                            process or task by which IBM StoredIQ examines and classifies data in your network. Using 
                            IBM StoredIQ Administrator, harvests can be scheduled, edited, and deleted.

                            be created and managed within IBM StoredIQ Administrator. Although infosets are a core component 
                            of IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench, system infosets are created as a shortcut for users in IBM StoredIQ 
                            Administrator.

                            is represented by the indexes. Actions are run by data servers on indexed data objects. Any errors 
                            or warnings that are generated as a result of an action are recorded as exceptions in IBM StoredIQ 
                            Data Workbench.

                            of data objects in the system, storage use, and the number of identical documents in the system. You 
                            can create custom reports, including Query Analysis Reports for e-discovery purposes, and

                            autoclassification models, integrates the IBM® Content Classification's classification model into 
                            the IBM StoredIQ infoset-generation process. Data Experts can use IBM Content Classification to 
                            train a classification model, which is then registered with IBM StoredIQ Administrator. The 
                            registered classification model can be applied to an existing infoset in IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench 
                            to generate new metadata for the objects in the infoset. Metadata can be used in rule-based filters 
                            to create new infosets.

                            to IBM StoredIQ AppStack, it can detect new data in documents during indexing and make these new insights 
                            searchable. For example, a sensitive pattern cartridge can enable IBM StoredIQ to detect passport numbers, 
                            phone numbers, and other IDs.

                            To apply the analysis logic contained in the cartridge, you must run a Step-up Analytics action that uses 
                            the cartridge on an infoset. IBM StoredIQ examines all documents in the infoset, applies the analytics, and 
                            then stores the analysis results in the IBM StoredIQ index.

                            Distributed. DataServer - Classic refers to the regular data servers. It uses either the current PostgreSQL or 
                            Lucene index as an index.

                            Postgres database. It increases the scalability and flexibility of the IBM StoredIQ deployment in a way that it can 
                            manage much larger amounts of data. Without adding more data servers, data that is managed by the IBM StoredIQ 
                            deployment can be increased by adding new nodes to the Elasticsearch cluster. Search queries perform better on 
                            DataServer - Distributed.

                Big data is a pervasive problem, not a one-time occurrence. It is easy for most companies to realize that big data 
                is problematic, but it is hard to identify what problems they have. Big data is all about the unknown, but the 
                unknown cannot be off limits. IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench can help you learn about your data, make educated decisions 
                with your most valuable asset, and turn your company's most dangerous risk into its most valuable asset.

                IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench is a data visualization and management tool that helps you to actively manage your 
                company's data. It helps you to determine how much data you have, where it is, who owns it, and when it was last used. 
                When you have a clear understanding of your company's data landscape, IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench helps you take 
                control of data. You can make informed decisions about your data and act on that knowledge by copying, copying to 
                retention, or conducting a discovery export. 
            </p>
            <p class="- topic/p ">

                            This virtual disk can be resized according to expectations on the amount of harvest data to be stored. For 
                            purposes of estimation, the index storage requirement for metadata is about 30 GB per TB of managed source data. 
                            Full-text indexing requires an extra 170 GB per TB. Therefore, the default data disk size is targeted for managing 
                            10 TB of source information.

                            When under load, the data server can use much RAM; therefore, having ample swap space is prudent. The minimum swap 
                            size is equal to the amount of RAM configured for the virtual machine. For best performance under load, place this 
                            disk on the highest speed data store available to the host.

                The general size limits for a data server are 150 million objects or 500 defined volumes, whichever limit is reached first. 
                Assuming an average object size of 200 KB equals about 30 TB of managed storage across 30 volumes of 5 million objects each, 
                the index storage requirement for metadata on ~30 TB of storage that contains uncompressed general office documents is ~330 
                GB (11 GB per TB). Add 100 GB per TB of managed storage for full-text or snippet index. For example, to support 30 TB of 
                storage that is indexed for metadata, you need 8 TB indexed for full-text search and extracted text (snippet cache) of 8 TB 
                for auto-classification. A total of 1.9 TB of storage is required (metadata: 330 GB, full-text: 800 GB, snippet cache: 800 GB).

                Data-server performance is impacted by the IOPS available from the storage subsystem. For each data server under maximum 
                workload, at least 650 IOPS generally delivers acceptable performance. In the situations where there is a high load on the system, 
                the IOPS that is used can reach up to 7000 with main write operations.

                If you deploy this type of data server, you must also deploy an Elasticsearch cluster with at least one node. If you deploy a cluster 
                with more nodes, each of the Elasticsearch nodes must meet the listed requirements.

                The required memory depends on the index size that is handled by the data node. For a better performance, consider increasing the memory. 
                The total memory available to the node must be distributed between the host operating system, the Elasticsearch java heap space, and the 
                kernel file system caches. For example, if the system has 32 GB memory, 2 GB must be allocated for the host operating system, 15 GB for 
                the java heap space, and the remaining 15 GB for the file system caches.
