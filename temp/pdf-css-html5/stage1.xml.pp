                            are currently under management, which data server is responsible for that volume, the state 
                            of the volume after indexing, and the amount and size of information that is contained by each 
                            volume. Administrators can also add volumes to and delete volumes from data servers through

                            train a classification model, which is then registered with IBM StoredIQ Administrator. The 
                            registered classification model can be applied to an existing infoset in IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench

                unknown cannot be off limits. IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench can help you learn about your data, make educated decisions
